# OpenGL, SDL & C template

What I use for my OpenGL projects, mostly with C. The template requires that you put all the .h files in a include folder and the .c (src) files in a folder called src. Then you also need a build folder named build were all the object files are placed.
The template requires Cglm, Glad and SDL.
